# Company-Attrition
Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to predict company attrition

## Dataset
The data is from a company trying to control attrition. It contains 11428 employees that stayed as class 1 and 3571 of the ones that resigned as class 0. 80% was trained and 20% used for evaluation. By training the data of the employees using various features like satisfaction_level,	last_evaluation,	number_project,	average_montly_hours etc the company can predict if an employee is likely to resign in a bid to optimize their decision making
